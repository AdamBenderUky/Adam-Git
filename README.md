# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various Project Euler problems implemented in Python.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Aimed at those who enjoy problem-solving and computational exploration, it features problems in a wide range of categories including number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.

### Folder Structure

- `src/` : Contains the Python scripts for solving each problem.
- `data/` : Reserved for any data files that might be used in the problems.

## Solved Problems

### Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5
**Description:** Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.  
**Solution:** [problem_1.py](src/problem_1.py)  
**Result:** 233168

### Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
**Description:** Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.  
**Solution:** [problem_2.py](src/problem_2.py)  
**Result:** 4613732

### Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor
**Description:** Find the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143.  
**Solution:** [problem_3.py](src/problem_3.py)  
**Result:** 6857

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
